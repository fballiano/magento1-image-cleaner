# The best image cleaner for Magento 1.x and OpenMage

Why the need for yet another image cleaner?
---------
Because I couldn't find any (actively supported) module with all the features I needed

Features
---------
- Identify and remove orphan category images (reading data from the default "image" attribute and any other custom attribute of type "image").
- Identify and remove orphan product images (reading data from media_gallery)
- Check before delete: you can review the identified images before removing them
- Compatible with Magento 1.9 and OpenMage 20.0 on PHP 7.2, 7.3, 7.4

Backup!!!
---------
Backup your database and files before launching the cleaning process!!!
This module is provided "as is" and I'll not be responsible for any data damage.
